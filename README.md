# 231HonorsProject
Originally a project meant to demonstrate AWS hosting, moved to GitHub for longevity.

Created as an assignment to receive Honors credit in a non-Honors course. Intended to be an alternative
way to host HTML files as a website without requiring a host and domain for public access.

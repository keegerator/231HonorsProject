        <h2>Three Projects to Demonstrate AWS/S3</h2>
        <p>This website is comprised of three static webpages meant to demonstrate
            the usability of AWS/S3 to host files in buckets and navigate them in
            the form of a website.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This website was created for COSC231 - Internet Based Computing, as an Honors
            Project by Keegan Dwyer.</p>

        <p>Project designed and implemented Fall 2020 - Completed by December 1st, 2020</p>

                    canvas color from a pre-determined set of colors. The "Destroy Artwork" button deletes all strokes
                    within the canvas and resets the background color to white.

                    This Magic 8 Ball has a set of pre-determined answers, much like the original, that when

                    Items, costs, and quantites are added to an array of objects that, once added to the cart, display the items.
                    After all the desired items are added to the cart, clicking the "Checkout" button will total the cost
                    of each item, giving a grand total.
